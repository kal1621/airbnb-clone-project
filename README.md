# airbnb-clone-project

 Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This comprehensive application allows users to search for, book, and manage listings, providing a hands-on experience in full-stack development.

 Project Goals
- Develop a Functional Booking Platform: Create an application that mimics the core features of Airbnb, enabling users to browse and book accommodations.
- Enhance Technical Skills: Gain practical experience in backend and frontend development, database design, and API integration.
- Promote Collaborative Development: Work with team members using GitHub to simulate real-world development practices.
- Implement Security Best Practices: Incorporate security measures to protect user data and ensure secure transactions.
- Establish CI/CD Pipelines: Set up automated deployment processes to streamline updates and maintain code quality.

 Tech Stack
- Backend Framework: Django
- Database: MySQL
- API Development: GraphQL
- Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional frameworks like React)
- Containerization: Docker
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD platforms)


## Team Roles

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level web framework for building web applications quickly and efficiently. It simplifies the development of complex web applications by providing a robust set of features for handling web requests, routing, and database interactions.

### MySQL
A relational database management system used to store and manage the application's data. It provides a structured way to define, manipulate, and query data, ensuring data integrity and security.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides more flexibility than traditional REST APIs by enabling clients to specify their data requirements.

### HTML
The standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures the content of the application, allowing for the display of text, images, and other media.

### CSS
A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of web pages. It enhances the visual appearance of the application, allowing for styling and layout adjustments.

### JavaScript
A programming language that enables interactive elements on web pages. It is used for client-side scripting, enhancing user experience through dynamic content.

### Docker
A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, simplifying deployment and scaling.

### Git and GitHub
Version control tools used for tracking changes in the codebase. Git allows for collaboration among team members, while GitHub provides a platform for repository management and project collaboration.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool that automates the software development process, allowing for continuous integration and deployment. It helps streamline workflows and ensures that code changes are tested and deployed efficiently.
